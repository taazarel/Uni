# §5.1 Properties of Estimators
A good Estimator has these properties
- Consistency
- Bias
- Efficiency
Which are explained as...
?
- Estimators are consistent when $\lim_{n \to \infty} â = a$
- If its expectation value is equal to the true value $\langle â \rangle = a$
- Lastly. An estimator is efficient when its variance is small. This just means that we should pick the model which gives the smallest variance.

# §5.2 Estimating the Mean
To estimate the mean we... :: use the Central limit theorem (CLT)[^1]

# §5.3 Estimating the Variance
The variance can be shown

[^1]: Remember the variance of this mean. This mean is consistent and unbiased.
