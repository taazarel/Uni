# General Properties of distributions
## A simple distribution
The outcome of $P(A|B)=...$::$P(A)P(B)$ given mutual exclusivity.
If given a set of probabilities $P(r)$ which are defined by the outcome r we have... :: a probability distribution. 

## The law of large numbers
Small sample sizes in statistics leave much room for error. Thus if we wish to diminish this error we... :: increase the sample size. Since the law of large numbers states that when $N \to \infty$ then $\frac{M}{N}=P$.

## Expectation values
We can compute the expected result of a probability distribution... :: $$E(r)=\sum_{r}rP(r)$$(3.1)[^1] Any function of r (f(r)) has a expectation value defined in the same way (3.2)

As $N \to \infty$ then the mean... :: approaches the expected value.

## Probability Density Distributions (KDE)
When working with continuous sets we can not set a specific size for measurements. However, this is fixed by... :: denoting the probability of an outcome finding itself inside a given range.

The probability of a result between a and b is... :: $$\int_{a}^{b}P(x)dx $$
# The Binomial Distribution


[^1]: Where E(r) is the expectation value. Also somtimes written as $\langle r \rangle$ or $\mu$. r is the result and P(r) is the probability for the result.
