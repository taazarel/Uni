- Name: The 7-up Multiverse
- Category: **Food and drink**
- Description: *So often we look at superheroes across different universes. Never do we take the time to aknowledge the little changes across these vast places. Changes such as the differences between 7-up flavors in the different verses. Well no more! Now is the time to finally decide which is the greatest universe, based not on strength, nor virtuous character, but on our ability to make good soda.*
